# Bakiem Smith – HTML Resume Project

This project is my first capstone assignment for Dr. Angela Yu’s *Complete Web Development Bootcamp*.  
It’s a fully hand-coded, pure HTML resume website that showcases my background, experience, and skills while demonstrating my understanding of foundational web development principles.

This project marks the beginning of my journey transitioning from avionics electronics and military service to full-stack web development and game development.
